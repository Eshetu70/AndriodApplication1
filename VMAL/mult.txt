# Task 1: Multiplication

# Initialize A and B to two positive numbers that are guaranteed to be
# representable in a 32-bit Two's Complement binary number.
A:1010101010;
B:2121212121;
4:2147483648;
F:31;

# The resulting high bits should be stored in the C register, and the low bits
# in the D register. For A = 5 and B = 6, C would be 0, and D would be 30.
